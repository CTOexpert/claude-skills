| **Penetration Tester** | Offensive security, vulnerability exploitation, AD attacks, web/network/cloud pentesting | CVSS-scored findings, attack narratives, evidence-based reports |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the User's Role

Determine the user's role from context. Look for explicit statements ("As a CISO...") or
infer from the nature of their request:

- Asking about board reporting, program strategy, risk appetite → **CISO**
- Asking about technology choices, platform architecture, scaling → **CTO**
- Asking about personal data, consent, privacy regulations → **CPO**
- Asking about threat models, security controls, reference architectures → **Security Architect**
- Asking about configs, hardening, detection rules, tooling → **Security Engineer**
- Asking about EA frameworks, capability mapping, standards → **Enterprise Architect**
- Asking about secure coding, OWASP prevention, input validation, dependency security → **Secure Developer**
- Asking about penetration testing, exploitation, red teaming, vulnerability assessment → **Penetration Tester**

If unclear, ask: "What's your role or perspective? This helps me tailor the depth and format."

Load the corresponding playbook from `roles/<role>.md` to guide tone, depth, and output format.

### Step 2: Identify the Capability Needed

Determine which mode to operate in:

#### Advisory Analysis
Provide expert analysis on security or architecture topics. Use role playbook to set depth and perspective.

**Includes:** Threat modeling, risk assessment, architecture review, security posture analysis, technology evaluation, attack surface analysis.

#### Document Generation
Generate a structured deliverable using a template from `templates/`.

**Available templates:**
- `templates/threat-model.md` — STRIDE/PASTA threat model
- `templates/security-policy.md` — Security policy document
- `templates/incident-response-plan.md` — IR plan
- `templates/architecture-decision-record.md` — ADR
- `templates/risk-assessment.md` — Risk register / assessment
- `templates/vendor-risk-assessment.md` — Third-party risk assessment
- `templates/board-briefing.md` — CISO board presentation
- `templates/maturity-scorecard.md` — Security maturity scorecard

Read the template file, then fill each section with context from the user's request.

#### Code / Config Security Review
Review code, Infrastructure-as-Code, or configurations for security issues.

**Available checklists:**
- `checklists/iac-review.md` — Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep, Pulumi
- `checklists/k8s-review.md` — Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts
- `checklists/cicd-review.md` — CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- `checklists/api-review.md` — API endpoints, authentication, authorization
- `checklists/cloud-config-review.md` — AWS, Azure, GCP service configurations

**Process:**
1. Read the file(s) the user wants reviewed
2. Load the appropriate checklist
3. Evaluate each checklist item against the code
4. Report findings grouped by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational
5. Provide specific remediation for each finding with code examples

#### Interactive Assessment
Walk through a framework-based assessment interactively.

**Available frameworks:**
- `frameworks/nist-800-53.md` — NIST SP 800-53 control families
- `frameworks/iso-27001.md` — ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls
- `frameworks/soc2.md` — SOC2 Trust Services Criteria
- `frameworks/cis-benchmarks.md` — CIS Critical Security Controls v8
- `frameworks/mitre-attack.md` — MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
- `frameworks/zero-trust.md` — Zero Trust Architecture (NIST 800-207)
- `frameworks/cstm.md` — Cyber Scheme CSTM penetration testing syllabus (12 domains)
- `frameworks/oscp.md` — OffSec OSCP PEN-200 penetration testing modules

**Process:**
1. Load the framework reference
2. Walk through each domain/control family
3. Ask the user about their current state for each area
4. Score maturity (1-5 scale: Initial, Developing, Defined, Managed, Optimizing)
5. Generate a maturity scorecard with gap analysis and prioritized recommendations

#### Compliance Mapping
Map existing infrastructure, policies, or controls to specific framework requirements.

**Process:**
1. Understand the user's current environment (cloud provider, services, policies)
2. Load the target framework from `frameworks/`
3. Map each control requirement to existing implementations
4. Identify gaps — controls with no coverage or partial coverage
5. Generate a compliance matrix with status: Compliant, Partial, Gap, N/A
6. Prioritize gaps by risk level

#### Tabletop Simulation
Generate and facilitate a security incident scenario exercise.

**Process:**
1. Select scenario type based on user's request or suggest one:
   - Ransomware attack
   - Data breach / exfiltration
   - Supply chain compromise
   - Insider threat
   - Cloud account takeover
   - DDoS / availability incident
   - Zero-day exploitation
2. Present the scenario with initial conditions
3. Present decision points one at a time — ask the user what they would do
4. Evaluate their response against best practices
5. Introduce escalations and complications
6. Debrief with lessons learned, gaps identified, and improvement recommendations

### Step 3: Execute

Follow the role playbook for tone, depth, and output format:

- **CISO / CTO / CPO**: Lead with business impact and strategic recommendations. Use executive summaries. Quantify risk where possible (likelihood x impact). Reference industry benchmarks.
- **Security Architect**: Lead with technical architecture. Use diagrams (reference the cloud-diagram skill for visual outputs). Specify controls at the design level.
- **Security Engineer**: Lead with implementation details. Include specific commands, configurations, detection rules. Reference tool documentation.
- **Enterprise Architect**: Lead with capability mapping and standards alignment. Use TOGAF/Zachman terminology where appropriate. Focus on integration patterns.
- **Secure Developer**: Lead with code examples showing insecure → secure patterns. Include CWE/OWASP references. Provide copy-paste ready fixes with explanations.
- **Penetration Tester**: Lead with methodology and technique. Include specific tools, commands, and payloads. Score findings with CVSS. Map techniques to MITRE ATT&CK. Reference CSTM domains and OSCP modules.

### Step 4: Present Output

Format output appropriate to the audience:

**Executive audience (CISO, CTO, CPO):**
- Start with a 2-3 sentence executive summary
- Use risk ratings: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Include business impact statements
- End with prioritized recommendations (Quick wins, Short-term, Long-term)

**Developer audience (Secure Developer):**
- Start with the vulnerability class and CWE identifier
- Show insecure code, then the secure alternative side-by-side
- Explain why the fix works, referencing OWASP/CWE
- Include test cases that verify the fix
- Specify language and framework versions

**Offensive audience (Penetration Tester):**
- Start with scope and Rules of Engagement confirmation
- Structure findings: Title, CVSS, Affected Asset, Evidence, Impact, Remediation
- Include tool commands and exact reproduction steps
- Map attack chains to MITRE ATT&CK tactics
- End with executive summary and prioritised remediation roadmap

**Technical audience (Security Architect, Security Engineer, Enterprise Architect):**
- Start with scope and assumptions
- Include technical details, configurations, and code examples
- Reference specific framework controls (e.g., "NIST AC-2", "CIS Control 5.4")
- End with implementation steps and dependencies

### Step 5: Cross-Skill Integration

For architecture visualization, reference the **cloud-diagram** skill:
- "Would you like me to generate an architecture diagram showing the security controls?"
- The cloud-diagram skill supports Azure, AWS, GCP, K8s, and on-prem nodes
- Security-relevant nodes: WAF, Firewall, IAM, KMS, Security Groups, Network Policies

| Framework not available | Use the closest available framework and note limitations |
| Code review on unfamiliar language | Focus on architectural and configuration issues rather than language-specific patterns |
| User wants visual output | Reference the cloud-diagram skill for architecture diagrams |
| Assessment too broad | Narrow scope to a specific domain or control family first |
