# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 — Information Security Management Systems

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). The 2022 revision restructured Annex A from 14 categories (114 controls) to 4 themes (93 controls), adding 11 new controls and consolidating others. Organizations certify against clauses 4-10 of the main body, with Annex A providing the reference control set.

## Key Changes from 2013 to 2022

- Control count reduced from 114 to 93 through merging and consolidation.
- 14 control categories reorganized into 4 themes: Organizational, People, Physical, Technological.
- 11 new controls introduced: Threat intelligence (A.5.7), Cloud services security (A.5.23), ICT readiness for business continuity (A.5.30), Physical security monitoring (A.7.4), Configuration management (A.8.9), Information deletion (A.8.10), Data masking (A.8.11), DLP (A.8.12), Monitoring activities (A.8.16), Web filtering (A.8.23), Secure coding (A.8.28).
- Each control now tagged with attributes: control type, information security properties, cybersecurity concepts, operational capabilities, and security domains.
- Clause 6.3 added: Planning of changes to the ISMS must be conducted in a planned manner.

## Certification Assessment Focus Areas

Auditors typically concentrate on the following during certification and surveillance audits:

1. **Scope and context** (Clauses 4.1-4.3) -- Clear definition of ISMS boundaries and interested parties.
2. **Risk assessment and treatment** (Clauses 6.1, 8.2, 8.3) -- Documented methodology, risk register, treatment plan linked to Annex A controls.
3. **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** -- Justification for inclusion or exclusion of each Annex A control.
4. **Leadership and commitment** (Clause 5) -- Evidence of top management involvement and information security policy.
5. **Competence and awareness** (Clauses 7.2, 7.3) -- Training records, role-based competency evidence.
6. **Operational planning and control** (Clause 8.1) -- Documented procedures for critical security processes.
7. **Performance evaluation** (Clause 9) -- Internal audit programme, management review minutes, monitoring metrics.
8. **Continual improvement** (Clause 10) -- Nonconformity tracking, corrective actions, evidence of improvement over time.
9. **Incident management** (A.5.24-A.5.28) -- Incident response procedures, evidence of incident handling and lessons learned.
10. **Supplier security** (A.5.19-A.5.23) -- Third-party risk assessments, contractual security clauses, cloud service controls.
