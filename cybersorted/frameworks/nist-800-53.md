# NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 — Security and Privacy Controls

NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It is the foundational control framework used by U.S. government agencies and widely adopted in the private sector. Rev 5 (September 2020) integrates privacy controls directly into the catalog and removes the "federal-only" designation, making it applicable to all organizations.
