## 2. Methodology

This assessment rates security maturity across defined domains using a five-level scale. Each level builds upon the capabilities of the previous level.

### 2.1 Maturity Levels

| Level | Name        | Description                                                                                                     |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Initial     | Processes are ad hoc, reactive, and undocumented. Security activities are performed inconsistently, if at all. No formal ownership or accountability. |
| 2     | Developing  | Some processes are documented and repeatable for specific areas. Awareness exists but practices are inconsistent across the organisation. Limited metrics. |
| 3     | Defined     | Processes are formally documented, standardised, and communicated across the organisation. Roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned. Basic metrics are tracked. |
| 4     | Managed     | Processes are measured, monitored, and actively managed. Quantitative metrics drive decision-making. Controls are regularly tested and validated. Continuous improvement is practised. |
| 5     | Optimizing  | Processes are continuously improved based on data-driven analysis. The organisation proactively adapts to emerging threats. Security is embedded in culture and business strategy. Industry-leading practices are in place. |

### 2.2 Assessment Approach
